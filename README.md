to use Github Pages to deploy a Jekyll website (per codecademy) - SEE, there's more

20180902 Changing in order to use Github Pages so I can run projects within organization (within user stevehayward)
In order to do this I am saving Jekyll index as indexJekyll and creating new index for experimentation (initially Hello World).

Add projects folder so index can select the appropriate project.
